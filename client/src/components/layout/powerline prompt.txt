I need to build a PowerLine recruitment platform for my team, Magnificent Worldwide Marketing & Sales Group, to promote Talk Fusion. This is an independent promoter tool (not affiliated with Talk Fusion's corporate site) that helps with lead generation, education, and team building.

Core Requirements
Landing Page: Create a professional landing page that explains:
Video email technology and its market potential
Talk Fusion's business opportunity and compensation plan
Our PowerLine recruitment system advantages
PowerLine System: Implement a visual system that:
Places pre-enrollees in sequential order
Shows real-time (or simulated) growth
Creates urgency with position numbers
Displays new members joining below a prospect's position
Pre-Enrollment Flow:
No-cost, no-obligation signup
7-day decision window with countdown timer
Clear path to conversion as Talk Fusion promoter
Welcome page with position confirmation
Education Center:
Resources explaining Talk Fusion products
Compensation plan breakdown
Video email benefits and statistics
Training materials for team building
Promoter Tools:
Dashboard for tracking pre-enrollees
Lead management system
Team growth visualization
Resources for helping new members
Technical Specifications

Backend: Node.js/Express with MongoDB

User Journeys
Please implement these key user journeys:

Prospect Journey:

Promoter Journey:
Registration → Dashboard access → Lead tracking → Pre-enrollee conversion → Team building
Key Components to Create
CountdownTimer: Visual timer showing days, hours, minutes, seconds until decision deadline
PowerLineVisualization: Dynamic display of sequential member placement
PreEnrollmentForm: Collects prospect information without financial commitment

Important Notes
This is NOT integrated with Talk Fusion's official systems
No actual payment processing in the app
The conversion process involves manually helping prospects sign up on Talk Fusion's site
Commission tracking is for reference only, not linked to Talk Fusion's payment system
The primary value is in education, visualization, and systematic recruitment
Deliverables
Frontend code for all pages and components
Backend API for user management and PowerLine data
Real-time update system for PowerLine visualization
Mobile-responsive implementation
Clean, professional design following the specified guidelines
Please provide code snippets, design recommendations, and implementation guidance based on these requirements. Focus on creating an effective, professional tool that helps my team build our Talk Fusion business through education and systematic recruitment.
